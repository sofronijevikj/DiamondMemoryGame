This memory game project was developed for DiamondClinik, an orthodontic aesthetic practice located in North Macedonia. The game provides an engaging and interactive experience for users, enhancing their visit to the clinic's website. With vibrant visuals and intuitive gameplay, patients can enjoy a fun distraction while waiting for appointments or browsing the clinic's online presence.

The game features a sleek design, incorporating DiamondClinik's branding elements seamlessly. Players can challenge themselves to match pairs of cards while being subtly exposed to the clinic's branding and aesthetic. It not only serves as a form of entertainment but also reinforces brand recognition and fosters a positive association with the clinic.

Through this project, DiamondClinik demonstrates its commitment to innovation and patient engagement, showcasing its dedication to providing a modern and enjoyable experience for visitors to its website.

This project involves the development of a memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    HTML: Defines the structure of the web application, including elements such as buttons, containers, and game cards. It also includes links to external resources like fonts and stylesheets.

    CSS: Provides styling instructions for the entire game, including background colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. It ensures an aesthetically pleasing appearance and consistent user experience.

    JavaScript: Controls the game's behavior, including logic for shuffling and displaying cards, counting moves, and checking for matching pairs. It also enables user interaction with the game, such as flipping cards and starting or stopping the game.

Together, this combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows for the creation of an interactive and entertaining memory game that is both visually appealing and functional.
